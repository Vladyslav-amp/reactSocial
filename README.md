# Social_React

This project is aimed more at training skills. Every React individual component has been written with BEM methodology. Due to its versatility, this component can be used in another project as part of the missing code (ex. Adding product to the list or Log-in/out form). 
There are 5 main section:

 - Product 

 - Customers 

 - Income 

 - Promote 

 - Help

### Product
##### Soon...

### Customers
This section show customers list with personal information and we can find some user by his name, city or phone.

CustomersData I get from my .json file, also I can get data from api using fetch. For creating Table component I used React library - React-table. Its allows to stay flexible and functionaly table`s element. I wrote a functions that return props should be assigned in table elements (thead, tr, tdoby, td), this function get all users from CustomersData by "ID".

Also I created table block with pagination and filter in Javascript without React Hooks.

In search block i used React Hook - useGlobalFilter. The global filter allows the user to filter data in all columns at once, which is useful for tables containing a large amount of information.

In pagination block, I created a : 
- simply function for showing all pages 
- function generatePageButtons which generate
- simply navigate buttons

It`s not ready block yet, need to fix and add some style for table.
